                <p>Growing up, I was captivated by the worlds of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Shenmue, and Jet Set Radio. These games weren’t just entertainment; they were windows into meticulously crafted universes where stories came alive, environments breathed with detail, and music set the pulse of every moment. I didn’t realize it at the time, but these experiences planted the seeds for my future as a game designer and developer.</p>
                <p>My creative journey began with film. As a child, I was deeply moved by movies like E.T., Jurassic Park, and Disney classics. These films opened my eyes to the power of storytelling and the beauty of visual imagery. I even went to film school, eager to refine my craft, but the traditional structure didn’t align with the path I was meant to take. Dropping out wasn’t the end—it was a pivot.</p>
                <p>In 2017, I began experimenting with Blender and Unity, diving into 3D modeling and game design as a hobby. At first, it was just an exploration—a way to blend my love for storytelling with the endless possibilities of interactive media. But like many others, the pandemic in 2020 became a turning point. With more time on my hands and a renewed focus, I dove headfirst into game development, spending countless hours honing my skills, building worlds, and rediscovering my purpose.</p>
                <p>What shaped my creative perspective wasn’t just games or films—it was life itself. I’ve been fortunate to draw inspiration from two vastly different environments. Growing up in the vibrant, bustling boroughs of New York City, I was surrounded by a kaleidoscope of cultures, art, and energy. At the same time, my roots in the Dominican Republic exposed me to a striking contrast: the island’s raw, colorful charm—a mix of warmth, resilience, and beauty that I carry with me in everything I create.</p>
                <p>These dual influences shaped my understanding of the world. I learned to see beauty in complexity, to celebrate both the polished and the imperfect, and to tell stories that resonate across different perspectives. Today, as a game designer and developer, I strive to bring these elements into my work. My goal is to create experiences that are not only visually striking but also emotionally immersive—where players can connect with the worlds I build on a deeply personal level.</p>
                <p>Game development has given me the tools to combine my passions: storytelling, design, and music. It’s a journey that began with wide-eyed wonder at fantastical adventures and evolved into a commitment to craft something meaningful. As I continue to grow in this space, I’m reminded that inspiration can come from anywhere—the games we play, the places we’ve been, and the stories we choose to tell.</p>

                <p>My journey as a producer began in 2004, when my older brother installed FL Studio on my PC. After school, I would immerse myself in creating beats, proclaiming to my friends that I'd become the greatest reggaeton producer of all time. My obsession with reggaeton lasted from 2003 until the genre's fundamentals began to dilute. Hip hop was a constant in my life, but my passion ignited when I discovered videos of producers in the studio sampling records. Clips of J Dilla, Kanye West, The Neptunes and the electronic duo Justice captivated me.</p>
                <p>Music runs in my blood—my father was a merengue percussionist who played with renowned acts in the Dominican Republic. I attended Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music, where I gained both basic and advanced music theory knowledge. While playing in the school band, I had the honor of meeting Willie Colon, a salsa legend and acclaimed record producer whose music influenced my life and my parents'.</p>
                <p>My goal has always been to create music that feels incredible to listen to, inspired by the legends before me.</p>
